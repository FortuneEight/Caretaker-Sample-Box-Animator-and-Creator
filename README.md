# Sample Box Animator and Creator

The source code can be found in sample_box_animator.py and sample_box_creator.py. The fonts I use are tahoma_bold for the top at 53pt and tahoma for the bottom at 46pt.

**HOW TO USE**

1. Sample Box Creator<br>
   Direction: -50 would be 50% Left, 50 would be 50% Right, etc. (Only supports integers between -100 and 100.)
   For Top Texts and Bottom Texts: Seperate new lines with the carat symbol "^".
2. Sample Box Animator (credit to vanpassinby for help in making the process more user friendly)<br>
   Percentage to rescale to: Make sure this is an integer (50% = 50.) This text box will only enable if "Rescale Video" is checked.
